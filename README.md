# Ember-Orbit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/orbitjs/ember-orbit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/orbitjs/ember-orbit)

Ember-Orbit is a library that integrates
[Orbit.js](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit.js) with
[Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) to provide flexibility and
control in your application's data layer.

Ember-Orbit features:

* Compatibility with any sources that implement interfaces from the Orbit Common
  library.

* Stores that wrap Orbit sources and provide access to their underlying data as
  easy to use records and record arrays.

* Stores that can be cloned (fully or partially) and edited in isolation, so
  changes can be either discarded or applied back to the original source.

* Live-updating filtered record arrays and model relationships.

* A data schema that's declared through simple model definitions.

* The ability to connect any number of sources together with Orbit transform
  and request connectors.

* Deterministic change tracking including forward, inverse and transactional
  changes.


## Status

Ember-Orbit is undergoing heavy development. Interfaces may change, so please
use with caution.

Many capabilities of Orbit must still be accessed through Orbit objects that are
not yet fully encapsulated by Ember-Orbit. There are plans to "Emberify" these
aspects of Orbit so that they are more easily and consistently used from with
Ember-Orbit.


## Installation

Orbit and Ember-Orbit can be installed with [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install orbit
bower install ember-orbit
```

[A separate shim repo](https://github.com/orbitjs/bower-ember-orbit) is
maintained for Ember-Orbit's Bower releases.


## Using Ember-Orbit

### Configuration

For an Ember CLI application, see the instructions further below.

If you just want to use the global (non-AMD) builds of Orbit and 
Ember-Orbit, include the following scripts on your page:

```
<script src="/bower_components/orbit.js/orbit.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/orbit.js/orbit-common.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/ember-orbit/ember-orbit.js"></script>
```

These three files will provide the `Orbit`, `OC`, and `EO` global namespaces,
respectively.

You may also want to include scripts that provide additional Orbit sources.


### Initialization

Configure Ember-Orbit with an application initializer that sets up Orbit and
registers a "main" store and schema to be available in your routes and
controllers:

```javascript
  App.initializer({
    name: 'injectStore',
    initialize: function(container, application) {
      Orbit.Promise = Ember.RSVP.Promise;
      application.register('schema:main', EO.Schema);
      application.register('store:main', EO.Store);
      application.inject('controller', 'store', 'store:main');
      application.inject('route', 'store', 'store:main');
    }
  });
```

### Sources

Source are very thin wrappers over Orbit sources. A source can be declared as
follows:

```javascript
  LocalStorageSource = EO.Source.extend({
    orbitSourceClass: OC.LocalStorageSource,
    orbitSourceOptions: {
      namespace: "myApp" // n.s. for localStorage
    }
  });
```

Orbit sources can be directly accessed in any instantiated EO.Source via
the `orbitSource` property.

### Stores

Stores extend sources and are also repositories for models. All of the data in a
store is maintained in its internal source.

Stores are by default defined with the `orbitSourceClass` set to an Orbit
memory source class: `OC.MemorySource`.

Stores provide immediate (i.e. synchronous) access to its models through the
following methods:

* `all` - returns all models of a specific type.
  For example: `store.all('planet')`.

* `filter` - returns a live record array of models of a specific type that are
  filtered by a filter function.

* `retrieve` - returns model with a specific client or remote id.
  For example: `store.retrieve('planet', '123')` or
  `store.retrieve('planet', {id: '1'})`.

You can make requests to stores through the following asynchronous methods,
all of which return a promise:

* `find`
* `add`
* `remove`
* `patch`
* `findLink`
* `addLink`
* `removeLink`

Stores themselves are promisified and resolve when all outstanding async
requests resolve. For example: `store.then(function() { didComplete() });`

It's often more convenient to call methods directly on records (i.e. model
instances).

### Models

Your model definitions help define the central schema used by Orbit throughout
your application.

Model definitions can use the following helpers:

* `attr()` - attributes
* `hasOne()` - has-one relationships
* `hasMany()` - has-many relationships

A relationship can optionally declare an `inverse`, which should point to a key
on the related model. Orbit will ensure that relationships and their inverses
will be updated together.

Here's an example set of model definitions:

```javascript
  Star = Model.extend({
    name: attr('string'),
    planets: hasMany('planet', {inverse: 'sun'})
  });

  Moon = Model.extend({
    name: attr('string'),
    planet: hasOne('planet', {inverse: 'moons'})
  });

  Planet = Model.extend({
    name: attr('string'),
    classification: attr('string'),
    sun: hasOne('star', {inverse: 'planets'}),
    moons: hasMany('moon', {inverse: 'planet'})
  });
```

Records can access properties and relationships through `get` and `set`.
Relationships are stored in proxy objects which will be kept in sync with
the underlying store's source data.

```javascript
store.add("planet", {name: "Jupiter"}).then(
  function(jupiter) {
    jupiter.get("moons").pushObject(io);
    jupiter.set("classification", "gas giant");
  }
);

store.then(function() { // all requests resolve
  console.log(io.get("planet.name")); // Jupiter - inverse relationship has resolved
});
```

You can also make requests to a model's underlying store through the following
asynchronous methods, all of which return a promise:

* `remove`
* `patch`
* `findLink`
* `addLink`
* `removeLink`

Note that working with a model synchronously via `get` and `set` is generally
more convenient than calling the above async methods.

A model's relationships can be re-queried by calling `find()` on a relationship
object. This triggers the associated `findLink` call and returns its promise.
Related records will be updated through transformations to the underlying
source. Any changes should be reflected by the time the promise resolves.

For example:

```javascript
planet.get('moons').find().then(function() {
  console.log(planet.get('moons.length'));
});
```

### Direct Access to Orbit

Many aspects of Orbit are not yet encapsulated by Ember-Orbit and must be
handled by working with the underlying Orbit sources directly.

Orbit sources can be directly accessed in any `EO.Source` (or `EO.Store`) via
`orbitSource`.

Use sources to configure connectors, monitor transforms, and access remote
servers.

### Configuration with Ember-CLI

First, remove `ember-data`, which is configured by default:

```
npm rm ember-cli-ember-data --save-dev
```

Next, add `orbit.js` and `ember-orbit` as dependencies in `bower.json` and
install them.

```
bower install
```

In your `Brocfile`, import dependencies for Orbit and Ember-Orbit. It's 
recommended that you import the named AMD ('.amd.js') files so that modules 
may be used within ember-cli. 

For example:

```javascript
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

var app = new EmberApp();

// Required Orbit imports
app.import('vendor/orbit.js/orbit.amd.js', {
  exports: {'orbit': ['default']}
});
app.import('vendor/orbit.js/orbit-common.amd.js', {
  exports: {'orbit-common': ['default']}
});

// Optional import of local storage source
app.import('vendor/orbit.js/orbit-common-local-storage.amd.js', {
  exports: {'orbit-common/local-storage-source': ['default']}
});

// Optional import of JSON API source and serializer
app.import('vendor/orbit.js/orbit-common-jsonapi.amd.js', {
  exports: {'orbit-common/jsonapi-source': ['default'],
            'orbit-common/jsonapi-serializer': ['default']}
});

// Required Ember-Orbit import
app.import('vendor/ember-orbit/ember-orbit.amd.js', {
  exports: {'ember-orbit': ['default']}
});

module.exports = app.toTree();
```

Create an initializer for Ember-Orbit within your application's `initializers`
directory.

The following example creates a store backed by local storage: 

```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';
import Orbit from 'orbit';
import LocalStorageSource from 'orbit-common/local-storage-source';
import EO from 'ember-orbit';

var LocalStorageStore = EO.Store.extend({
  orbitSourceClass: LocalStorageSource,
  orbitSourceOptions: {
    namespace: "my-app" // n.s. for localStorage
  }
});

export default {
  name: 'injectStore',
  initialize: function(container, application) {
    Orbit.Promise = Ember.RSVP.Promise;
    application.register('schema:main', EO.Schema);
    application.register('store:main', LocalStorageStore);
    application.inject('controller', 'store', 'store:main');
    application.inject('route', 'store', 'store:main');
  }
};
```

### Customizing schema

You can customize functions used in Ember Orbit Schema to generate id or pluralize/singularize schema names.
```javascript
var Schema = EO.Schema.extend({
  idField: 'id',
  remoteIdField: 'id',
  
  generateId: function() {
    // return a UUID
    var s4 = function () {
      return Math.floor((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000)
                 .toString(16)
                 .substring(1);
    };
    return s4() + s4() + '-' + s4() + '-' + s4() + '-' + s4() + '-' + s4() + s4() + s4();
  },
  pluralize: function(word){
    // information is irregular
    return (word==="information")?"information":word+"s";
  },
  singularize: function(word){
    // information is irregular
    return (word==="information")?"information":word.substr(0, word.length - 1);
  }
});
```

## Building and Testing Ember-Orbit

The Ember-Orbit project is managed by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Once you've
installed Grunt and its dependencies, you can install Ember-Orbit's development
dependencies from inside the project root with:

```
npm install
```

Distributable versions of Orbit can be built to the `/dist` directory by running:

```
grunt package
```

Orbit can be tested by running:

```
grunt test:ci
```

Or from within a browser
(at [http://localhost:8010/test/](http://localhost:8010/test/)) by running:

```
grunt server
```

Ember-Orbit's docs can be generated to the `/docs` directory by running:

```
grunt docs
```


## Acknowledgments

Ember-Orbit owes a great deal to [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data),
not only for the design of several interfaces but also for the base code used to
manage record arrays.

It is hoped that, by tracking Ember Data's features and interfaces where
possible, Ember Orbit will also be able to contribute back to Ember Data.
